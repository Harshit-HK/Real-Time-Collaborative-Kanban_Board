# ðŸ§  How I Implemented Smart Assign (Explained in My Own Words)

**The Smart Assign feature in my project is designed to intelligently allocate tasks to users based on priority and workload distribution. Hereâ€™s how it works:**

## ðŸ”¹ Summary
1. The Smart Assign logic balances priority with workload in an intelligent, multi-step process:

1. Immediate assignment if any user has no tasks.

1. Scoring algorithm for Low/Medium priorities.

1. Priority-aware filtering followed by scoring for High priorities.

1. Redundancy checks to avoid repeat assignments.

1. This approach ensures fairness, responsiveness, and flexibility in team task distribution.

## ðŸ”¹ Priority-Based Routing
- When a task is assigned via Smart Assign, the system first checks its priority level:

- If the task is Low or Medium priority, it routes the assignment to Function 1.

- If the task is High priority, a separate logic layer is triggered for advanced handling (explained below).

## ðŸ”¹ Function 1: Scoring Algorithm
- In Function 1, I calculate a score for each user based on their currently assigned tasks:

- Each task contributes a score based on its priority: for example, Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 4.

- These scores are aggregated to create an array of user-task scores, where each object represents a user and their total load.

- The array is then sorted in ascending order based on total score.

- The user with the lowest total score is selected for the task.

## ðŸ”¹  Function 2: High Priority Handling Algorithm
- When a High priority task is assigned, the algorithm first filters users based on their current high-priority task load:

- It identifies users with no or the fewest high-priority tasks, then assigns the task to that user.

- If multiple users qualify no high-priority tasks (filter), the system falls back to Function 1 to evaluate their overall workload and selects the one with the lightest task load.

- This ensures that high-priority tasks are distributed fairly and efficiently, without overloading a single user.

## ðŸ”¹ Edge Case: No Tasks Assigned 
If a user currently has zero tasks assigned, the Smart Assign system will immediately assign the task to that userâ€”regardless of its priority. This bypasses all scoring logic, since the assumption is that an unoccupied user is the most eligible.

## ðŸ”¹ Validation Checks
To prevent redundant assignments:

The system checks if the task is already assigned to a user.

If an attempt is made to reassign it to the same user, a notification (or popup) is triggered and prevent duplication.

The user is then given the option to manually reassign the task or proceed with Smart Assign or try after some time.
